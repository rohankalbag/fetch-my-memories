## Getting Started

### Running on Local Python 

You'll need `python3` for this and an internet connection, also make sure to get the email address (of the form `xxxxx@iitb.ac.in`) and password for your yearbook account if you have forgotten it.    
Note: The web scrape may not work on IITB InstiNet

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohankalbag/fetch-my-memories
cd fetch-my-memories
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generateYearBook.py YOUR_EMAIL_ID YOUR_PASSWORD
```

To also get the messages written by and written for your friends (Note that this takes considerably more time, averages at 45 seconds per friend) 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohankalbag/fetch-my-memories
cd fetch-my-memories
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generateYearBook.py YOUR_EMAIL_ID YOUR_PASSWORD true
```

You can find your yearbook ready as `yearbook.pdf`
